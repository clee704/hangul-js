hangul.js is a simple JavaScript library that provides functions to manipulate
Hangul text. Each function is capable of a specific task, such as:

  * to check if a character is a Hangul syllabic block (such as "ê°€")
  * to compose/decompose a Hangul syllabic block from/into jamo
  * to convert between different input methods (e.g. Dubeol and QWERTY)
  * and more

Applications using this library:
  * Dubeol/Sebeol/QWERTY Converter (http://lemon-factory.net/haconv)
  * Versatile Hangul Text Converter (http://lemon-factory.net/hconv)
