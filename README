hangul.js is a simple JavaScript library that provides functions to manipulate
texts written in Hangul. Each of the functions is capable of a specific task:

 * to check if a character represents a syllable
 * to disassemble a syllable into segments and vice versa
 * to convert texts between different input methods (e.g. Dubeol <-> QWERTY)
 * etc.
