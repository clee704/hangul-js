hangul.js is a simple JavaScript library that provides functions to manipulate
texts written in Hangul. Each of the functions is capable of a specific task:

* to check if a character represents a syllable
* to disassemble a syllable into segments and vice versa
* to convert texts between typed on different input methods
  (e.g. Dubeol-sik <-> QWERTY)
* etc.
