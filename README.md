[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/clee704/hangul-js.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/clee704/hangul-js)

hangul.js is a simple JavaScript library that provides functions to manipulate
Hangul text. Each function is capable of a specific task, such as:

* to check if a character is a Hangul syllabic block (such as "ê°€")
* to compose/decompose a Hangul syllabic block from/into jamo
* to convert between different input methods (e.g. Dubeol and QWERTY)
